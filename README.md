# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

---

### Description
Team project. Introduction to popular sorting algorithms, and using big O notation to indicate time and space complexity.

--- 

### Requirements
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, â€¦ is totally forbidden.
* The following format is expected for big O notation:
  * `O(1)`
  * `O(n)`
  * `O(n!)`
  * n squared -> `O(n^2)`
  * log(n) -> `O(log(n))`
  * n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
  * n + k -> `O(n+k)`

Please use the "short" notation (don't use constants). Example: `O(nk)` or `O(wn)` should be written `O(n)`. If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.

### Provided file(s)
* [`print_array.c`](print_array.c)
* [`print_list.c`](print_list.c)
* definition of `listint_t` for [`sort.h`](sort.h)
* [`0-main.c`](tests/0-main.c) [`1-main.c`](tests/1-main.c) [`2-main.c`](tests/2-main.c) [`3-main.c`](tests/3-main.c)
